# Server setup

## Environment Recommendation

For the production environment, it is recommended to use a stable and secure Linux distribution such as Ubuntu LTS or Debian. Ensure the server is regularly updated and secured. The server should be able to run Docker containers and be a persistant virtual machine, i.e. not on-demand or serverless option. In AWS these are called EC2 and in Azure VMs. 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM would support about 5000 registered users, and 200 concurrentÂ users.

## Update your system (optional)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Install Docker

Install Docker and Docker Compose.
