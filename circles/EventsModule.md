# **Events & Calendar Integration for Kamooni**

Kamooni’s new focus on real-world impact calls for an **events and calendar** module emphasizing local activities and volunteering. Such a feature would let communities create and browse local events (meetups, cleanups, workshops, etc.) while still supporting online gatherings. For instance, the open-source LAUTI platform (built for community organizing) treats each *event* as tied to an organizing group and place, supporting multi-day or recurring events[lauti.org](https://lauti.org/#:~:text=Events%20for%20your%20community). Volunteer-oriented systems (e.g. HelperHelper) similarly emphasize schedule visibility: they let administrators sync all community events to external calendars (Google, Outlook, etc.) and embed a public calendar view so volunteers can see and sign up for opportunities[helperhelper.comhelperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=Helper%20Helper%20provides%20the%20ability,Google%20Calendar%2C%20Outlook%2C%20and%20more). In Kamooni, an events module could similarly make upcoming in-person (and virtual) meetups visible on community pages, maps, and feeds, driving user engagement toward concrete actions.

## **Core Event Features and Use Cases**

- **Event Creation:** Community members (with permission) can create events specifying title, description, image/banner, start/end date and time, and location (with map coordinates or address). They should be able to mark events as *in-person*, *virtual* (with a link), or hybrid. Metadata like categories/tags or related causes can help filter events (similar to how causes guide feed content). For flexibility, events can be one-time or **recurring** (weekly meetings, monthly clean-ups), a common feature in volunteer apps[helperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=,17).
- **RSVP / Participation:** Attendees should RSVP or “join” an event, optionally assigning themselves to roles or tasks (e.g. “set up chairs,” “bring snacks”). The system can then track attendees and volunteer sign-ups. A checkbox list of roles or chores could be attached to events (like tasks) so organizers can assign responsibilities.
- **Visibility & Privacy:** When creating an event, users choose who can see it (public, all community members, or specific roles/groups) using the existing post-style permissions system. For example, Circle’s event feature lets organizers set events as public or private and controls RSVPs accordingly[circle.so](https://circle.so/events#:~:text=,or%20catch%20up%20with%20recordings). Kamooni can mirror this by allowing community admins to toggle an **Events** module and grant event-creation rights to specific user groups (just as they do for posts, proposals, etc.).
- **Calendar & List Views:** Events should be viewable in multiple ways. A **calendar view** (month/agenda) can show dates with event dots; clicking a date reveals events for that day. Libraries like FullCalendar (open-source, React-compatible) can render such views, and even pull in external event sources (e.g. Google Calendar) as data[fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/google-calendar#:~:text=events%20from%20Google%20Calendar)[fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/#:~:text=Open%20Source). A **list view** (chronological or filtered) lets users browse upcoming events easily. Most platforms offer both: for example, The Events Calendar plugin provides month, list, and day views with tooltips[wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/#:~:text=%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%20Rapidly%20create%20events%20%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F,Google%20Calendar%20and%20iCal%20exporting).
- **Map Integration:** Given Kamooni’s map-centric design, events should appear on the geospatial interface. Users could toggle an “Events” layer on the map showing event pins at locations, just like user/community pins. Clicking a pin or list item would pop up full event details (time, description, signup link). For inspiration, Timely’s *Map View* displays events as markers on a Google map alongside a list of upcoming events. The map and list sync as users pan/zoom, and clicking a marker opens the event page[time.ly](https://time.ly/demo/events-calendar-map-view-demo/#:~:text=events%20appear%20as%20markers%20in,is%20to%20click%20on%20it).

_Example: Timely’s “Map View” calendar displays events as pins on a map with an adjacent list of details. Events in the map view update as you pan, and clicking a pin or list item shows full event info[time.ly](https://time.ly/demo/events-calendar-map-view-demo/#:~:text=events%20appear%20as%20markers%20in,is%20to%20click%20on%20it)._

- **Notifications & Reminders:** The system should notify users of upcoming events they joined or that match their interests (e.g. causes or skill tags). Reminders before events help attendance. HelperHelper’s example shows that once a volunteer signs up, they can add the event to their personal calendar (Apple/Google/Outlook) and receive automated reminders[helperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=Helper%20Helper%20provides%20the%20ability,Google%20Calendar%2C%20Outlook%2C%20and%20more)[helperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=Add%20commitments%20to%20personal%20calendar). Kamooni can similarly offer “Add to Calendar” links or iCal/Google sync for each event.
- **External Calendar Sync (Nice-to-Have):** While not core, it’s useful if communities can export/import events. The WordPress Events Calendar plugin, for example, supports Google Calendar and iCal export[wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/#:~:text=%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%20Widget%3A%20Upcoming%20events%20list,Google%20Calendar%20and%20iCal%20exporting). Using a library like FullCalendar also allows reading events from a public Google Calendar feed[fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/google-calendar#:~:text=events%20from%20Google%20Calendar). Thus Kamooni could offer an iCal feed per community or events page, letting users subscribe in their own calendar apps.
- **Module Integration:** We recommend making **Events** a new community module (like Tasks or Proposals). Community admins can toggle it on/off and set which user groups may create events. The Events module would appear as a tab on community pages, alongside Feed, Tasks, etc. On each community’s page it would list their upcoming events and a mini-calendar widget or timeline. (This mirrors how other modules like *Goals* and *Issues* are integrated in Kamooni.)

## **Examples from Existing Platforms**

Several community and volunteer platforms offer relevant features:

- **Community Platforms (Circle, Wordpress, etc):** Circle’s platform includes an Events calendar where organizers “set events as public or private, display your event calendar, and enable RSVPs”[circle.so](https://circle.so/events#:~:text=,or%20catch%20up%20with%20recordings). Similarly, the popular open-source “The Events Calendar” plugin for WordPress highlights ease of event creation and multiple views: it includes month, list, and day views with Google Maps integration, saved venues/organizers, category tags, and the ability to export to Google/iCal[wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/#:~:text=%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%20Rapidly%20create%20events%20%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F,Google%20Calendar%20and%20iCal%20exporting). It explicitly supports both in-person and virtual events[wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/#:~:text=Easily%20create%20and%20manage%20an,team%20of%20developers%20and%20designers). These examples suggest Kamooni’s Events module should also allow event categorization, location data (maps), and handling of virtual links.
- **Volunteer Management Tools:** Systems like HelperHelper emphasize syncing calendars and easy sign-up. For instance, HelperHelper can “sync individual event signups or entire calendar listings” to Google/Outlook calendars and offers one-click integration with Google Calendar[helperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=Helper%20Helper%20provides%20the%20ability,Google%20Calendar%2C%20Outlook%2C%20and%20more). It can also embed a live calendar on websites so volunteers can “see upcoming events and quickly sign up”[helperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=Embed%20a%20calendar%20of%20events,on%20your%20website). They ensure that volunteers who sign up can add events to personal calendars without leaving the app[helperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=Add%20commitments%20to%20personal%20calendar). Although Kamooni may not build a full volunteer-management suite initially, these features indicate the value of calendar synchronization, embedded calendar widgets, and easy RSVP flows.
- **Open-Source Community Calendars:** LAUTI (German for “loud”) is an open source community calendar designed for activism and local events. It lets groups and places register events (including multi-day and recurring), and provides open-standard feeds (iCal/RSS) scoped by group/place for integration into other tools[lauti.org](https://lauti.org/#:~:text=Events%20for%20your%20community)[lauti.org](https://lauti.org/#:~:text=Feeds). It also plans an open API and ActivityPub support for federated calendars. We can take cues from LAUTI’s architecture: events are tightly linked to community groups and venues, and users have roles (admin, moderator, contributor) for event approval. Kamooni could similarly associate each event with a community and optionally require admin approval for posting.

## **UI/UX and Integration Considerations**

- **Map Interface:** Integrate events into the existing map discover view. Users could filter pins by “events only” or see events layered with community/user pins. The map’s hover/preview panel (used for users/communities) can adapt to show a summary of upcoming events at that location or a specific event’s details. Timely’s map view suggests showing events as distinct icons (perhaps color-coded by community or category) and updating the side list as you move around[time.ly](https://time.ly/demo/events-calendar-map-view-demo/#:~:text=events%20appear%20as%20markers%20in,is%20to%20click%20on%20it).
- **Feed (“For You”) Integration:** To make events prominent, the For You feed could include an “Events” tab or highlight sections for upcoming activities. Similar to how feed posts can be sorted by location or causes, events could be prioritized by proximity (“near me”) or relevance to a user’s selected causes. Each event post could appear in the feed with a clear date/time and a “Join” button. (Facebook’s event feed and Meetup’s listings offer analogous experiences, though we don’t have direct citations here.) Encouraging discussion around events (e.g. a chat thread or comments on an event) could also drive engagement.
- **Notifications:** Beyond calendar invites, Kamooni’s notification system can alert followers about new events or remind attendees shortly before an event starts. For example, if a user RSVPs, they could automatically get a reminder one day prior. These notifications fit into Kamooni’s existing notification bell logic.
- **Permissions & Access:** Use the existing group-based access rules. Just as with posts, a new event creation form should let the creator choose “who can see this event” (e.g. public, followers, or specific groups). Community admins should be able to restrict event creation/posting to certain roles (e.g. admins/moderators only, or allow all members). This mirrors the proposed workflows for community posts or proposals, but specialized for events.

## **Technical Implementation Tips**

- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Consider using a mature calendar library like **FullCalendar** for the calendar UI (month/week/day views) – it’s open source and supports React/Next.js[fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/#:~:text=FullCalendar%20provides%20a%20highly%20performant,JSX%20for%20rendering%20nested%20content). FullCalendar can also pull events from Google Calendar feeds[fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/google-calendar#:~:text=events%20from%20Google%20Calendar), which might simplify external integration.
- **Data Model:** Extend the community schema to include an “events” collection/table. Each event record needs fields for datetime(s), location coordinates, description, image, etc. Link events to the community and to the user who created it. Implement recurrence as either separate event copies or by storing a pattern (depends on complexity needed).
- **API & Feeds:** Expose events via the existing REST API and consider adding an iCal/RSS feed endpoint per community so users can subscribe externally[lauti.org](https://lauti.org/#:~:text=Feeds). This also makes future federation (e.g. ActivityPub) easier, as LAUTI plans to do.
- **Modular UI:** Make the Events page resemble the existing modules’ look/feel. It could have a header (with event count) and then a two-pane layout (list and calendar, or list and map). Reuse styles from the Feed and Tasks modules for consistency.
- **Right-Panel Previews:** When hovering/clicking an event pin or feed item, use the right-side preview panel (as with communities/users) to show a quick view: event title, date/time, location, brief description, and RSVP button.

## **Conclusion**

Integrating an **Events & Calendar** module will shift Kamooni toward its goal of real-world action by making local meetups and volunteer opportunities front-and-center. Drawing on best practices from community platforms (Circle, WordPress’s Events Calendar) and volunteer tools (HelperHelper), Kamooni’s implementation should include event creation with date/location, RSVP management, map and calendar views, and sync/export options[wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/#:~:text=Easily%20create%20and%20manage%20an,team%20of%20developers%20and%20designers)[helperhelper.com](https://www.helperhelper.com/how-it-works/calendarintegrations/#:~:text=Helper%20Helper%20provides%20the%20ability,Google%20Calendar%2C%20Outlook%2C%20and%20more). By leveraging the existing permission system (who can post/join events) and linking events to communities, we can ensure a seamless fit. In the next steps, we can prototype the Events module interface (list, calendar, map) and plan data schemas, then iterate by gathering user feedback on scheduling features.
