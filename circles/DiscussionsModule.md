# Implementing an Internal Discussions Feature in Kamooni

## Rationale for a Dedicated Discussions Module

The **Discussions** feature will serve a different purpose than the existing Announcements/Feed module on Kamooni. Currently, announcements are used for broadcasting news or updates to the community, much like a Facebook page post. In contrast, a discussion forum provides a space for in-depth, back-and-forth conversation on internal topics. Many community platforms distinguish these functions: announcements are one-way, _need-to-know_ updates (often from leaders/admins) whereas discussion forums allow open participation and dialogue among members[\[1\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=The%20announcement%20forum%20should%20be,Some%20examples%20of%20this%20are)[\[2\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=Who%20can%20post%20to%20the,discussion%20forum). For example, IBM’s community guidelines note that an announcement forum is for _“need-to-know info”_ to all members, while a discussion forum is _“a place for members to connect with one another, share insights, or get feedback”_[\[1\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=The%20announcement%20forum%20should%20be,Some%20examples%20of%20this%20are)[\[2\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=Who%20can%20post%20to%20the,discussion%20forum).

In practice, **feeds/announcements** are optimized for real-time updates and short-form content – ideal for quick news, status updates, or one-off posts. Forums, on the other hand, are intended for **long-form, thoughtful conversations**. A forum-style discussion module encourages detailed posts and extended back-and-forth threads[\[3\]](https://help.growthzone.com/clients/differences-between-the-feed-and-forum#:~:text=,form%20content). Rather than immediate reactions or brief comments, members engage in _“in-depth discussions, long posts, \[and\] extended conversations”_[\[3\]](https://help.growthzone.com/clients/differences-between-the-feed-and-forum#:~:text=,form%20content). This aligns with Kamooni’s goal of facilitating internal community dialogue around ideas, opinions, and “informal” topics that don’t fit into structured modules like Tasks or Proposals. By providing a dedicated discussions space, communities can deliberate on internal politics, brainstorm initiatives, or process ideas collaboratively, without cluttering the announcement feed.

## Forum-Style Design and User Experience

We propose a **forum-style layout** for the Discussions module, taking inspiration from modern community forums like Discourse. This means the discussion threads will be presented in a **flat chronological format** where each reply is given full prominence (not just a tiny indented comment). Discourse, for example, uses a simple flat thread where _“replies flow down the page in a line”_, and it allows users to expand quoted context as needed without losing their place[\[4\]](https://www.discourse.org/features#:~:text=Discourse%20is%20a%20simple%2C%20flat,conversation%20without%20losing%20your%20place). Adopting a similar design will make every reply in Kamooni discussions feel like a substantial contribution, encouraging users to read through entire threads rather than skimming a top post and jumping to reactions.

**Encouraging thoughtful engagement:** The forum layout is specifically geared towards more mindful communication, in contrast to the quick-scrolling nature of feeds. Content in discussion threads can be longer and more detailed, and the interface should encourage reading the full post before responding. By avoiding the rapid-fire feel of a social media feed and instead presenting a continuous discussion (with perhaps only subtle nesting or quoting), we help steer users away from “gut reaction” comments. In fact, the nature of forums inherently _“encourages thoughtful replies \[and\] ongoing conversations”_ over impulsive responses[\[3\]](https://help.growthzone.com/clients/differences-between-the-feed-and-forum#:~:text=,form%20content). Features like infinite scrolling can replace page-by-page navigation, so users simply **keep reading by scrolling**[\[5\]](https://www.discourse.org/features#:~:text=just,more%3F%20Keep%20scrolling%20down) – this makes consuming a long discussion more seamless, reducing the friction to read all the way through.

**Rich posts with media:** To keep discussions engaging, the module will support rich text and images in both the original topics and in replies. Visual content can enliven a debate or help illustrate a point, so we should allow attaching or embedding images. Modern forums like Discourse support drag-and-drop image uploads in posts[\[6\]](https://www.discourse.org/features#:~:text=,Collaboratively%20edit%20wiki%20posts), and Kamooni can offer a similar capability. This ensures discussions are not just walls of text – users might share diagrams, screenshots, or photos relevant to the topic. However, the overall styling will remain clean and content-focused (akin to Discourse or other forum software), so that images enhance the conversation without overshadowing it.

Additionally, to further promote deep reading, we can introduce subtle features like **context expansion** or quoting. For example, Discourse lets readers click on a reply’s reference to see the quoted parent post inline[\[4\]](https://www.discourse.org/features#:~:text=Discourse%20is%20a%20simple%2C%20flat,conversation%20without%20losing%20your%20place). Implementing something similar (e.g. a “Show context” button on a reply if it’s answering an earlier comment) would help users follow sub-discussions without lots of scrolling. All these design choices – flat thread layout, full-width replies, infinite scroll, rich media support – are aimed at making the discussion feel like a **first-class forum** experience, distinct from the quick-browse announcement feed.

## Integration with Other Modules and Content

While Discussions will be a standalone module, it should not exist in isolation. Often, conversations will revolve around other pieces of content on the platform (tasks, proposals, goals, etc.). We plan to enable **cross-linking and referencing** between discussions and these modules. For instance, if a community is informally discussing a new project idea, they might reference a Proposal or Task in the thread. The system could auto-link such references – e.g. typing a task ID or URL could generate a small preview or at least a hyperlink. (Discourse provides a model for this with its auto-expanding links feature: when you paste a link on a line by itself, it will _“automatically expand to provide additional context”_[\[7\]](https://www.discourse.org/features#:~:text=Links%20automatically%20expand). We could implement a similar _onebox_ preview for internal Kamooni links, so linking to a proposal shows its title or status.)

Moreover, discussions could serve as a less formal companion to structured modules. For example, if a **Proposal** is too preliminary to formally submit, members might start a discussion thread to hash out the idea first. In this sense, the Discussions module can act as an **idea incubator or deliberation space**, complementing the Proposals module. We will ensure the UI allows easy navigation between a discussion and any linked module items. Perhaps a user viewing a task can see if it’s being discussed in the forum, or vice versa. This connectivity will make the platform feel cohesive, letting users seamlessly move from chatting about something to recording it as a task, event, or proposal when ready.

## Highlighting Active Discussion Topics

To foster engagement, Kamooni should surface the most relevant and active discussions to users. We intend to display **active discussion topics on the community’s home page or dashboard**, so that members can quickly see what conversations are hot and join in. Many successful community forums showcase trending or recent topics for this reason. For example, Pipefy’s community forum lists discussions with sorting options like _most viewed, most active, most recent,_ etc., which makes it easy for users to find lively threads[\[8\]](https://saaslandingpage.com/articles/12-great-examples-of-community-forum-website-design/#:~:text=announcements%20and%20the%20other%20for,questions). Spotify’s community page similarly highlights _“featured topics”_ and _“recently popular topics”_ in prominent sections[\[9\]](https://saaslandingpage.com/articles/12-great-examples-of-community-forum-website-design/#:~:text=Scrolling%20further%20leads%20you%20to,for%20all%20to%20contribute%20to).

In Kamooni, the community home could have a widget showing the latest active discussions (e.g. topics with recent replies) or the top trending topics (those with many participants or upvotes, if we introduce a liking mechanism). By calling attention to active threads, we ensure that important or interesting conversations get seen by community members. This helps drive timely participation — if a debate is ongoing about an urgent issue, members will notice it on the home page and can jump in. We may also allow pinning certain discussion threads (for moderators) to highlight key topics (similar to “pinned topics” or announcements, but within the discussion context). Over time, analytics like number of replies or views could inform automatically showcasing popular discussions, keeping the community dynamic and interactive.

## Moderation and Access Control

Any discussion feature must include moderation tools to maintain a healthy environment. In Kamooni’s case, we will extend our existing **permission system** (which already handles roles like admins, moderators, followers) to the Discussions module. This means community admins/moderators will have rights to manage the discussion threads. At minimum, they should be able to **delete or edit inappropriate posts and possibly close or remove entire threads** if needed. This basic moderation capability is in line with typical forum practices – for instance, Discourse allows both _inline moderation_ (per post) and bulk actions on topics[\[10\]](https://www.discourse.org/features#:~:text=Admin). It also includes community flagging systems and trust levels to empower users to help with moderation[\[11\]](https://www.discourse.org/features#:~:text=Trust%20system), though Kamooni might start with simpler controls (admin/moderator manual moderation) for now.

The Discussions module will also obey the **access control settings** of the community. Similar to other modules (Feed, Tasks, Proposals, etc.), we can configure who is allowed to view or contribute to discussions based on their membership status. For example, in a private community, only approved members will see the discussion threads; in a public community, discussions might be readable by anyone but only members can post – this can be adjusted as needed. The IBM community example distinguishes that announcements are typically pushed to all members, whereas discussion forums require members to opt-in or at least be members of the group[\[12\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=Who%20can%20post%20to%20the,discussion%20forum)[\[13\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=Will%20members%20receive%20an%20email,post%20in%20the%20discussion%20forum). Kamooni can likewise ensure that **only community members can post in that community’s discussions**, keeping the conversation internal. We might also implement subscription or notification settings, so interested members get alerted to new discussion posts (possibly an opt-in model to avoid spamming everyone by default, as IBM did[\[13\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=Will%20members%20receive%20an%20email,post%20in%20the%20discussion%20forum)).

**Content moderation features** can be expanded in the future. For instance, we might incorporate a reporting mechanism where any user can flag a post for moderator review, helping keep discourse civil. Since Kamooni is geared toward constructive changemaker communities, maintaining respectful and productive discussions will be key. Clear **community guidelines** (akin to IBM’s “Community Netiquette”[\[14\]](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/leandra-naranjo-user-group-manager/2017/02/09/announcement-vs-disscussion-forums#:~:text=Terms%20of%20Use)) and active moderation will help prevent the discussions module from devolving into noisy or off-topic chatter.

## Conclusion

In summary, adding a Discussions module to Kamooni will provide a **forum-like space for internal community communication** that complements the existing announcement feed and action-oriented modules. By adopting a Discourse-style layout – long-form posts with equal emphasis on replies, enriched with images and easy-to-read threading – we encourage members to engage deeply with topics and with each other. Communities will be able to deliberate on ideas, ask questions, or debate issues in a dedicated area purpose-built for conversation rather than quick updates. Featuring active topics on the community home page will draw members into those conversations and keep the momentum going. Meanwhile, robust moderation controls and alignment with Kamooni’s permission system will ensure that discussions remain safe, on-topic, and accessible only to the appropriate audiences. This research-backed approach should help Kamooni effectively incorporate discussions in a way that **strengthens community collaboration and dialogue** – fulfilling our vision of a social platform for changemakers that supports both action and discussion.
